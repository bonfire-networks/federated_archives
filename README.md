# Federated Archives Alliance

**Federated Archives Alliance** is a Bonfire flavour that connects and empowers public media archives worldwide. The instance enables archives to maintain their autonomy while participating in a collaborative network, allowing their collections to be discoverable and accessible across the fediverse.
The goal is to facilitate seamless sharing of movie catalogs between participating archives, with granular permission controls that respect each organization's policies. Curators, researchers, and authorized users can search across the entire federated network, create curated collections, and contribute to the curation of metadata while preserving the provenance of each item.

## Extensions
Federated Archives bundles essential extensions from [Social](https://github.com/bonfire-networks/social) and adds the following:
